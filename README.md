# Building an AJAX File Uploader with NodeJs on Apache server

This code is an AJAX file uploader with NodeJs, express, and formidable hosted on Apache server.

The NodeJS application is built by Fady Makram at [coligo](http://coligo.io/building-ajax-file-uploader-with-node/)

The Apache conf file is modified based on http://www.codingtricks.biz/run-nodejs-application-apache/

To visit the uploader, the hosts file on the local computer needs to be configured with the IP address of the server.
